# RF-SilentInstaller
# These scripts are for the installation of the OpenText RightFax client application silently.
# To use this script effectively you should place it within the extracted directory tree of the Client Installer zip package. So long as the script is along side the "RightFax Product Suite - Client.msi" the rest of the pathing should fall properly in place.
